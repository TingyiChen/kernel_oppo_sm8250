Usage:

Run ath6kl-fwlog-record on the ath6kl device to record firmware log into
a file.

Command line:
ath6kl-fwlog-record <path to fwlog_block> <path to log file> <max length>

Maximum length is the maximum number of bytes that will be stored into
the log file. When more data is available, oldest entries are dropped.

For example:
ath6kl-fwlog-record /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/ath6kl/fwlog_block \
    /tmp/ath6kl-fwlog 1000000

Copy the /tmp/ath6kl-fwlog to the host that is used to analyze the log,
e.g., with dbgParser.

The firmware log entries in the log file generated with
ath6kl-fwlog-record needs to be reordered before parsing it with
dbgParser. This can be done with ath6kl-fwlog-reorder on the same host
that has dbgParser.

for example:
ath6kl-fwlog-reorder /tmp/ath6kl-fwlog /tmp/ath6kl-fwlog.reorder
dbgParser -d $OLCA -t2 /tmp/ath6kl-fwlog.reorder /tmp/ath6kl-fwlog.txt
