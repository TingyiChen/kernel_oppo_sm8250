# Each subtree potentially has an include directory
#   corresponding to the common APIs applicable to modules
#   rooted at that subtree. Accordingly, the INCLUDE PATH
#   of a module can only contain the include directories up
#   its parent path, and not its siblings
#
# Required for each makefile to inherit from the parent
