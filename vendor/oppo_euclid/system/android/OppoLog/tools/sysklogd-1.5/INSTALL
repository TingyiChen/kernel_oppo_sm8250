1.) READ the README.linux file and the accompanying man pages.  It will
    save you some frustration.

2.) Edit the Makefile for your installation.  NOTE that if you have not
    carried out step 1 you may make choices which could render your
    system and/or these utilities unusable.  Compile the utilities.
    Compilation has been tested with versions 2.5.8, 2.6.3 and 2.7.0 of
    the gcc compiler and libc versions 4.5.26 and 4.6.27.

3.) The FSSTND makes suggestions as to appropriate locations for
    system binaries.  Since not everyone agrees with standards it is
    up to the system administrator installing the utilities to choose
    the most appropriate locations for the binaries and their
    configuration files.  By default the package will compile and
    install following the FSSTND recommendations.  If a decision is
    made to change this behavior consult the makefile and the sources.
    The FSSTND define controls selection of values which may be
    influenced by the choice of conformance with the FSSTND or site
    preferences.

4.) For proper functioning both of these utilities are best run as root.
    This is probably not much of a problem since they will probably be
    started either by init or as part of the rc.* startup process.  There
    may be security concerns with running syslogd as root.  Please repeat
    step 1 if you are unsure of why this may be the case.

5.) If kernel address to symbol translation is desired there is the
    possibility that a new kernel will need to be compiled.  The patches
    to delimit kernel addresses requiring translation were added to
    kernel 1.3.43.  If this kernel or a newer kernel is used there is
    no need to modify the kernel sources.

    If a kernel earlier than this is used the kernel sources will have to
    be patched.  The patch to delimit addresses for translation is included
    with the sysklogd sources.  The necessary modifications are quite
    generic and should require little modification over a wide range of
    kernel sources.
