Welcome to the sysklogd package for Linux.  All the utility
documentation has now been moved into the man pages.  Please review
these carefully before proceeding.

Version 1.3 of the package is the culmination of about two years of
experience and bug reports on the 1.2 version from both the INTERNET
and our corporate Linux networks.  The utilities in this package should
provide VERY reliable system logging.  Klogd and syslogd have both
been stress tested in kernel development environments where literally
hundreds of megabytes of kernel messages have been blasted through
them.  If either utility should fail the development team would
appreciate debug information so that the bug can be reproduced and
squashed.

Both utilities (syslogd, klogd) can be either run from init or started
as part of the rc.* sequence.  Caution should be used when starting
these utilities from init since the default configuration is for both of
these utilities to auto-background themselves.  Depending on the
version of init being used this could either result in the process
table being filled or at least 10 copies of the daemon being started.
If auto-backgrounding is NOT desired the command line option -n should
be used to disable the auto-fork feature.

I have found work on the sysklogd package to be an interesting example
of the powers of the INTERNET.  Stephen, Juha, Shane, Martin and
myself have successfully collaborated on the development of this
package without ever having met each other, in fact we could pass on
the street without realizing it.  What I have developed is a profound
respect for the personal capabilities of each one of these
individuals.  Perhaps the greatest `Linux Legacy' will be that its
development/enhancement is truly an example of the powers of
international cooperation through the worldwide INTERNET.

We would be interested in keeping track of any and all bug
fixes/changes that are made.  At the time that work was started on the
sysklogd package the syslog(d) sources seemed to have fallen into
neglect.  This work started with and continues the believe that it is
important to maintain consistent standardized system utilities
sources.  Hopefully the Linux community will find these sources to be
a useful addition to the software gene pool.

There is a mailing list covering this package and syslog in general.
The lists address is infodrom-sysklogd@lists.infodrom.org .  To subscribe send a
mail to majordomo@lists.infodrom.org with a line "subscribe infodrom-sysklogd"
in the message body.

A second mailing list exists as infodrom-sysklogd-cvs@lists.infodrom.org.  Only
CVS messages and diffs are distributed there. Whenever new code is added to
sysklogd, CVS generates a mail from these changes which will be sent to
this list.  Discussions will take place on the first list.
